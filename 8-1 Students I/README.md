# 8-1 Students I (10 åˆ†)

Write a program that asks you 10 records of students. Each record consists of a name (w/o space), and scores for three courses (in integer, 1 to 5). Output a list as following and calculate average score (in float) of each student and each course. Output the lowest and highest score for each course.

```

**Evaluation standard**

1. result correctness
2. c++ code quality (compact and reasonable)
3. comments quality (clean and accurate)
4. c functions like `printf` and `scanf` are not allowed

**Required Files**: source code, makefile (Mac, Linux), exe (Windows)
